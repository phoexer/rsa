# Simple RSA Implementation
This is a simple implementation of the RSA algorithm. 
It is not meant to be a complete implementation, but rather a demonstration of the basic steps and as
an accompaniment to the posts I wrote about the RSA algorithm on https://mmusangeya.com/posts/day-13-rsa-encryption.

Also, it's me learning how to write programs in Rust.
